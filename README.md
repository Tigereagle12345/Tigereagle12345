## ***Hi People!***
                                                                  
I'm a random person who enjoys coding in python and shell. My main focus is using Python3 or Bash to create scripts for Cyber Security, as well as using        TensorFlow to make AI. I currently do most of my work on building a script for Cyber Patriots. 

At some point I'll probably learn some C++ or other C based language, but for now, I'm sticking to Python. I also plan to learn how to use libraries like PyGame to make games.

My favorite OS's to work with are Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10, although I like Windows a lot less.

Some of my friends are @ComradeCitrusFruit and I work with them on some projects!
