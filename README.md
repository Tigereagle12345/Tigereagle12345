Hi!
I'm a random person who enjoys coding in python and shell. My main focus is using Python3 or Bash to create scripts for Cyber Security, as well as using TensorFlow to make AI. I currently do most of my work on building a script for Cyber Patriots. Some of my friends are @ComradeCitrusFruit and I work with them of some projects!
